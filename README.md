# Mobile-Robot-Control

**Description:**

For this project, I was tasked of controlling a robot arm wirlessly. I was given a toy robot arm with a controller, I needed to reverse engineer the arm and learn how it worked with the controller. I then needed to create a way to wirelessly control the arm without the controller. The goals for the project were to:

  1. Learn how the arm operated with the controller
  2. Operate the arm wirelessly utilizing an ESP32
  3. Create a Android application that could control the arm

**Features:**

The features this project utlized an ESP32 to run the program on. I utlized C++ to program all the board. What makes this program unique is the Android application coded through MIT App Inventor. This program allowed us to create an Android application that would transmit different integers to the ESP32 on what button was being pressed. The esp32 would then run the received integer state. 

The periphals utlized were:

  * Robotic Arm
  * ESP32
  * Android Phone
  * MIT App Inventor
  * H Bridge Motor Drivers

**Programming Language:** C++

**Libraries/Frameworks:** N/A

***Environment:** Mobile
